# Publish to PyPI
#
# This workflow publishes nii2dcm on PyPI. The workflow triggers
# on release. The PyPI release is labelled according to the git tag
# specified in the GitHub Release user interface. For instance,
# if the TestPyPI release is v0.1.2.post16, then the GitHub Release
# tag should be entered as v0.1.3, which will propagate to PyPI.
# Subsequent developer commits will become v0.1.3.post1, v0.1.3.post2,
# and so on.
#
# This workflow will upload a Python Package using Twine when a release is created. For more information see:
# https://help.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#publishing-to-package-registries
#
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
