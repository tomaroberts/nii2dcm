# Publish to TestPyPI
#
# This workflow publishes nii2dcm on TestPyPI prior to
# production release onto PyPI. The workflow is intended to
# catch any issues arising during the release procedure to
# prevent unnecessary versioning issues on PyPI.
#
# This workflow will upload a Python Package using Twine when a release is created. For more information see:
# https://help.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#publishing-to-package-registries
#
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
